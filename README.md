# Personalised Youtube Playlist
## I. About 

Ever went down that rabbit hole where you are watching something on Youtube, and cut to an hour later you find yourself binge watching 'Friends funny clips' or something entirely different? 

***(If that little voice inside of you screamed YES!, don't worry we've all been there...)***

There are two major issues with the Youtube Algorithm that recommends videos on our wall. 

**1. It maximizes our screen time on the platform by recommending videos that we have a higher chance of clicking on.**
>How is that bad? Now, this is not a bad business model, but it certainly is disadvantageous as it only gives us is a little entertainment in exchange for keeping us in a potentially harmful dopamine loop.       


**2. It does not give users a control over what they watch.**
>This is a big one for me. As users of Youtube, we are limited to what the algorithm shows us unless we explicitly search for something.

<br>
I created this project to tackle these exact issues. After you are done setting up the environment for the code, all you have to do is enter a topic that you want to 
watch videos about and it will create a playlist of personalised videos for you.

>***Note***- For best results, search for broad topics like Data Science, Economics, Videography, UI/UX, Geo-politics, etc.
